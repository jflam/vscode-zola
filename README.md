# vscode-zola README

`vscode-zola` is an extension for writing blog posts using the
[zola](https://getzola.org) static site generator. The goal of the extension
is to take all the friction out of the writing process, giving you a smooth
distraction-free writing experience.

## Features

The key features of `vscode-zola` are:

- Automating the creation of new posts from a template using a single command
- Simplifying copying and displaying rich content from sites like YouTube,
  Twitter, and Instagram
- Previewing posts within VS Code in a side panel that shows the rendered
  HTML (done using the `zola serve` command)
- Setting up a `zola` environment by guiding you through the process for 
  installing the `zola` binary (it is a single file Rust executable) for your
  operating system.

## Requirements

`vscode-zola` does not have any dependencies outside of a working `zola` 

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those
and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the
`contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
